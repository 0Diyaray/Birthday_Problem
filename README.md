## Birthday Classroom Problem  
In a classroom with n students, what is the probability that at least two students share the same birthday?  
Assuming birthdays are equally likely to fall on any of the 365 days and are independent of each other, 
this probability increases quickly as the group size grows, surpassing 50% with just 23 students.
